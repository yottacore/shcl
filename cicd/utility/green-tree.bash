#!/usr/bin/env bash

##	Purpose:
##		Remember the trees a gate passed, so the pre-push hook can let through a
##		commit with the same tree instead of running the gate on it again. A tree
##		hash covers every tracked byte and file mode, so two commits that share
##		one cannot differ in anything the gate reads from the repo. The one thing
##		it reads from outside the tree is the installer drift check's pair of
##		remote refs, and a push to main judges the tree it pushes, not the refs.
##		The pre-push hook makes that one comparison itself before it skips.
##	Syntax:
##		green-tree.bash tree DIR          the tree `git add --all` would commit in DIR
##		green-tree.bash record DIR TREE   remember TREE, if DIR still holds it
##		green-tree.bash passed DIR TREE   is TREE remembered?
##	Exit: 0 = done or remembered, 1 = not recorded or not remembered, 2 = usage or git failure.
##	History: At bottom of script.
